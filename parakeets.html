                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Parakeets originated in Australia, where the species was recorded in 1804. Once this small animal was discovered, its beauty led to thousands of them being captured for trade. However, the long journey for transport and the lack of knowledge of their diet resulted in the death of more than 95% of the specimens captured.
<br>
<br>The most common colors are green, blue and yellow, but two centuries of breeding have produced new color varieties, such as gray and violet.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text pt-2 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Typically, budgerigars measure 18 cm from head to tip of tail and weigh about 35g, although some are slightly larger. The best known wild species has a light green underparts, a yellowish head and black stripes on the back of the head.
<br>
<br>However, the throat and forehead are yellow, with purple spots on the cheeks and three black spots on both sides of the base of the throat.
<br>
<br>There is a central black spot, which is only visible when the wings are outstretched. The bill, which is bent downward, is greenish-gray and the legs are bluish-gray, with two toes forward and two backward. This makes it easier for them to perch on tree branches or electrical wires, and also allows them to feed on seeds.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text pt-2 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Unlike other bird species, parakeets are very social animals. They usually live in flocks and are quite territorial, even among their own species. They usually have no problems socializing with humans, getting used to them or treating them as equals.
<br>
<br>When budgies live in captivity, there are a number of guidelines to help owners understand how the parakeet’s mood is. For example, when a parakeet preens, wipes its feathers with its beak and puts each feather in its place, it is an indication that the animal is preening, that is, that it is comfortable in its cage. Of course, they also wipe their beaks and make the usual cooing noise. However, some are shy and find it a bit difficult to sing.
<br>
<br>This is not the only signal emitted by the animal. Its position is also a message to its owner. If it is standing on one leg, it is resting, and if it stretches its wings and legs at the same time, it wants to move but the cage is too small and it feels cramped.
<br>
<br>If it raises its wings and its body becomes spherical, it is a sign that it is cold and needs warmth. If this is the case, the animal should be moved to a warmer area of the house or a sunlit area. However, if the wings lift away from the body and the beak opens slightly, it is a sign that it is too hot. In this case, it is advisable to fill the cage with a glass of water and bathe the animal to cool it down.
<br>
<br>When frightened, they cling to their body with their feathers, stiffen and breathe with difficulty. It is normal for them to raise their necks upwards. They may be frightened by noises outside their cage. If it is in the wild, it is not advisable to chase it back to the cage, it will return on its own.
<br>
<br>Unlike other animals, the parakeet loves sound, especially the sound of the environment around it. So if you turn on the TV or radio where he is, you may be surprised to see him. Interestingly, although they love sound, they are also very fearful and should be treated with care.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Budgies are sociable animals, but they can also be very territorial. If you have more than one, it is important that they live together from the beginning.
<br>
<br>Two males will fight over who owns the cage, who eats first, who drinks first, who rides the stick first…. They won’t kill each other, but they will hurt each other a lot. It is natural for females to fight each other, especially if there are other males in the cage, because it is the natural order of things.
<br>
<br>In case you have multiple parakeets, make sure that they live together from the beginning or are separated in different cages. These cages should be large enough to provide comfort and convenience to these adorable and colorful animals.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text pt-2 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Although it may not seem like it, it is very easy to determine the age and sex of a budgie. Age is determined by the wrinkles on the forehead. Young budgies have lines on their foreheads, while adults have smooth foreheads. Also, young budgies have less intense feather tones. Another possibility is eye color: juveniles have a completely black eye, while adults have a white ring with a black dot.
<br>
<br>The key to distinguishing males from females is in the wax, that is, in the upper part of the beak that surrounds the nostrils. In males this area is completely blue, while females have a white or cream-colored beak, except during the mating season, when it is brown.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text pt-2 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The most important question when breeding parakeets is: which cage to buy? Yes, the parakeet can get used to living a little more freely indoors, but it will spend most of its time in a cage. That is why it is important to choose the right cage.
<br>
<br>The minimum size should be at least 50 cm wide if you intend to have one budgie in it. If you have two, it is best to choose a cage at least one meter wide. Why so wide and so high? Actually, the height will be about 30 cm, but this is not so important. The reason is that budgerigars use more horizontal space than vertical space to move around. Ideally, the cage should have horizontal bars, as these animals like to climb up the cage walls to look out.
<br>
<br>What about the shape of the cage? Many people make the terrible mistake of buying a round cage or one that simulates the shape of a mansion. Buying such a cage will only disorient the parakeet. It is better to buy a square or rectangular cage. It is also not advisable to make the bars of the cage white, as this will make it difficult for the bird to see. The space between the bars should be at least 1 cm, because if it is less, the legs or the beak could get trapped. And the more doors, the better, to be able to place the drinker and the feeder.
<br>
<br>Once you have decided on the cage, the real problem comes: the accessories. Standard cages already come with a number of accessories such as food, perches or toys. But many of them fail in one thing: the feeder. Usually the feeders are hung on the outside of the cage and are transparent. This is not recommended for budgies, which are forced to stick their heads into a hole to eat. Also, because they are transparent, they make budgies think they can escape and will empty the feeder to do so.
<br>
<br>For this reason, the best feeders are those that hang in the cage, with the outer feeders removed and the holes left uncovered. They are easy to fill and relatively easy to clean. The drinker is the least of the worries. Simply choose a dark plastic drinking bottle and place it in the cage for the budgie to drink from.<br><br>Many people choose to leave the perches supplied with the cage, but they make a terrible mistake. They are plastic, white in color and grooved. These grooves cause sores on budgies and are not very suitable for perching on. It is better to replace these bars with natural branches. It is not necessary to buy one, as any properly cut branch will do.
<br>
<br>They offer better support for the budgie, are more resistant and do not cause injuries to the legs. In addition, these branches can be used to clean the beak and feet when it wants to lick itself.
<br>
<br>Like other animals, budgies love toys, because they help them escape from monotony. What they like the most is the swing, but also a rope or a ladder. It is not necessary to fill the cage with toys, as this causes stress to the animal. In addition, mirrors or toys that reflect light should be avoided at all costs, because it bothers and stresses them.
<br>
<br>It is advisable to line the bottom of the cage with newspaper to facilitate cleaning. In summer, it is good for the parakeet to have a cup or glass of water in the cage to cool down, but it should be removed when it is ready.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text pt-2 mbr-fonts-style display-4"><strong>Parakeet diseases
</strong><br>
<br>All animals are at risk of becoming ill or affected by some type of parasite. Parakeets are no exception and can suffer from various types of diseases or even parasites. Some of these diseases can be of hereditary origin, others due to poor feeding and even due to the environment in which they are. To know if something is afflicting him, we should look at his mood, if he is down or has stopped singing. Observe if there have been changes in plumage or spots have appeared. If our pets show any symptoms, we must go to the veterinarian urgently so that they can diagnose what is wrong and give them the appropriate treatment.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text pt-2 mbr-fonts-style display-4"><strong>Steps to train a parakeet
</strong><br>
<br>There is a big difference between a parakeet becoming attached to its owner and being a trained parakeet. It is not easy to achieve, but it can be done. The most important thing is patience and perseverance.
<br>
<br>The most important thing is that the parakeet is young, because it is easier to train and more docile. It is also important that the character is cheerful and playful. This is what to look for when buying a small parakeet. Be careful not to buy what is sold in stores as a “trained parakeet”. These birds only have their feathers clipped, so they cannot fly and are forced to stand on one of their toes to get out of their cage.
<br>
<br>Once you have the parakeet, you have to wait for it to adapt to its new environment, which takes a few days. You will notice that it has already adapted better to the environment when it starts singing or moving around the cage.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text pt-2 mbr-fonts-style display-7">To ensure the well-being of a parakeet, it is very important to know how to clean it properly. Washing it is an essential part of making our pet feel clean and loved. It is also important to wash it from time to time, so that it is healthy and happy. We can notice that our budgie feels dirty when, for example, he tries to clean his beak after eating or when he constantly wipes his feathers with his paws.
<br>
<br>Parakeets are very clean animals; but in summer, a container with water is very useful for them to refresh themselves while washing, and in winter it is a good idea to have a place for this purpose.
<br>
<br>There is no need to worry too much about the length of the claws, as they adapt well to the bars of the cage and those of the swings and perches. If you wish to cut them, it is best to rely on a professional. However, once done, it should be done every time, as the claws will tend to grow bent after the first cut.
<br>
<br>We must get a bath for parakeets, either for the cage or outdoors. It is important to know beforehand if our friend likes to bathe in this way, because many prefer to use a spray. If they are wet, they should not be exposed to the cold.</p>
